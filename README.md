# Co-working-Space-portal
problem statement:

One of the challenges of working in a team is lack of proper collaboration and interaction between the coworkers. According to a survey, 84% of respondents said they use instant messaging platforms to interact with coworkers. Create a platform that helps to remove communication barrier among coworkers of any organization, studentsâ€™ groups or team members working under any project, which should have features of Real-Time Group and Personal messaging, news feed, Secure files & docs sharing, Announcements Sharing, Events and Tasks manager all in one place. Which allows to create a team, track the team, and manage important projects, allows to see the status of any ongoing project without pushing the team or sending an email and helps every member of this group to view the status of any task in real time
